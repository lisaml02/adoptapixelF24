-   **Cluster Separation**:

    -   The plot shows **some degree of separation** between clusters, but there is also a fair amount of **overlap** between them. This suggests that the clusters arenâ€™t perfectly distinct in the reduced dimensions (PC1 and PC2), which is common for high-dimensional data being reduced to 2D.

    -   **Red and blue clusters** seem to have the most overlap, indicating that they share some similarities in the features used for clustering (i.e., surface conditions). However, there are regions where the red and blue clusters are more separated.

    -   The **green cluster** is more spread out and less densely packed, which could mean that the points in this cluster are more variable or that the features used in clustering did not separate them as well.

-   **Variability**:

    -   The PCA axes are showing the most variance in the data along the first two components (PC1 and PC2). Higher variance implies that the observations in that direction are more spread out. The plot suggests a moderate amount of variability along the x-axis (PC1) and slightly less along the y-axis (PC2).

-   **Cluster 2 (green)** seems smaller and perhaps less cohesive than the others, meaning it may represent a smaller subgroup in your dataset, or the conditions that define it are not as distinct.

-   **Overlap** between clusters may suggest that the features used for clustering (e.g., surface conditions like snow and leaves) may not have enough distinction to clearly separate the clusters based on these two components alone.

```

#### 1. **Principal Components (PC1 and PC2)**:

-   **PC1 (x-axis)** and **PC2 (y-axis)** are the first two principal components derived from the PCA analysis. These components are linear combinations of your original features (e.g., surface conditions like `snow_ice`, `leaves_on_trees`, etc.), and they capture the most variation in the dataset.

-   **PC1** explains the most variance, and **PC2** explains the second most variance. Together, they provide a lower-dimensional projection of your higher-dimensional dataset.

#### 2. **Clusters**:

-   Each color represents a different cluster (from 1 to 8), as determined by your K-means clustering algorithm.

-   The points within the same color (cluster) are grouped together because they share similar characteristics based on the surface conditions you used in clustering.

#### 3. **Cluster Separation**:

-   **Moderate Overlap**: You can see that the clusters are not completely separated. There's moderate overlap between several clusters (e.g., clusters 1, 4, and 3). This means that these clusters share some similarities in their surface condition features, and PCA has a hard time distinguishing them in 2D space.

-   **Some Separation**: Certain clusters show a higher degree of separation, such as:

    -   **Cluster 2 (blue)**: This cluster shows clearer separation from others, which indicates that the observations in this cluster are somewhat distinct in terms of their feature values.

    -   **Cluster 8 (yellow)**: Thereâ€™s some concentration of cluster 8 points in the lower-right region of the plot, indicating that the features in this cluster are somewhat different from those in other clusters.

    -   **Cluster 6 (brown)**: Appears somewhat concentrated in specific regions of the plot, indicating that this cluster might also represent a distinct grouping in the data.

#### 4. **Overlapping Clusters**:

-   Clusters like **cluster 3 (green)** and **cluster 7 (pink)** seem to overlap with several other clusters, meaning the points in these clusters share feature characteristics with observations in other clusters. This could indicate that these clusters are less well-separated and more complex to distinguish.

### Insights:

-   The **overlap** between some clusters indicates that the surface condition features used in clustering might not fully separate all observations into distinct groups. You might want to explore other dimensions or features to get a better separation.

-   **Cluster 2 (blue)** and **Cluster 8 (yellow)** show some better-defined separation, suggesting these clusters might represent more distinct environmental or surface conditio

```{r scree plot}
# Scree plot to show variance explained by each component
fviz_screeplot(pca_result, addlabels = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 50))

```

```{r analyzing clusters for snow ice and leave on trees}
# Group by cluster and summarize snow_ice and leaves_on_trees
summary_by_cluster <- clustering_data %>%
  group_by(cluster) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_snow_ice = mean(snow_ice),
    avg_leaves_on_trees = mean(leaves_on_trees),
    count = n()
  )

print(summary_by_cluster)

```

This will give you the average presence of snow (`snow_ice`) and leaves (`leaves_on_trees`) in each cluster. High values for `avg_snow_ice` in a cluster indicate that this cluster is strongly associated with the presence of snow. Similarly, high values for `avg_leaves_on_trees` indicate clusters that are strongly associated with leaves on trees.

```{r visualize clusters}
# Boxplot for snow presence across clusters

## DBSCAN Clustering

dataset involves environmental conditions, and clusters may not always be spherical or evenly distributed. DBSCANâ€™s ability to find clusters of arbitrary shapes and handle noise or outliers makes it a strong candidate. If you have areas where snow is present in dense regions or sporadically, DBSCAN can identify those clusters and flag outliers (e.g., areas with snow when they shouldnâ€™t have it). other methods won't work well for the size and nature of the data.

```{r installing and loading DBSCAN package}
# install.packages("dbscan")
library(dbscan)
```

```{r KNN distance plot}
# Find k-nearest neighbor distances (for example, k = 4)
kNNdistplot(data_for_clustering, k = 4)
abline(h = 0.5, col = "red", lty = 2)  # This line is a visual aid, adjust it based on the plot

```

looks like it starts at around 0.5

```{r apply DBSCAN}
# Run DBSCAN using eps = 0.5 and minPts = 10

```{r checking for overfitting again}
# Predict leaves_on_trees on the training set
pred_train_leaves <- predict(rf_dbscan_leaves, train_data)

# Confusion matrix to evaluate performance on the training set
confusionMatrix(pred_train_leaves, as.factor(train_data$leaves_on_trees))

# Predict snow_ice on the training set
pred_train_snow <- predict(rf_dbscan, train_data)

# Confusion matrix to evaluate performance on the training set
confusionMatrix(pred_train_snow, as.factor(train_data$snow_ice))

```

## Plotting Feature Importance

```{r plotting deaturing importance again}
# Plot variable importance for leaves_on_trees prediction model
varImpPlot(rf_dbscan_leaves)

# Check feature importance scores for leaves_on_trees prediction model
importance(rf_dbscan_leaves)

```

-   **MeanDecreaseAccuracy**: Measures the decrease in accuracy when the feature is excluded. The higher the value, the more important the feature is.

-   **MeanDecreaseGini**: Measures the contribution of the feature to reducing the Gini impurity in the trees. The higher the value, the more important the feature.

```{r}
# Plot variable importance for snow_ice prediction model
varImpPlot(rf_dbscan)

# Check feature importance scores for snow_ice prediction model
importance(rf_dbscan)

```

Pay special attention to the **`cluster_dbscan`** feature. If it has a high importance score, this indicates that the DBSCAN clusters significantly contribute to the model's predictions.
